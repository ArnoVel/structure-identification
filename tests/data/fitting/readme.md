# Fitting procedures

## SLOPE
Fits different models and finds the one that best balances goodness of fit and model complexity using MDL.
More details [can be found here](./slope)

## Gaussian Mixtures
Use a flexible amount of gaussian mixtures to figure out how complex the shape of a distribution is.
First experiments and figures [here](./gmm)

## Optimal Transport Losses
Matching cloud points & training generative models using Geometric losses (using [GeomLoss](https://github.com/jeanfeydy/geomloss)).
A sample can be found [here](./ot), the [rest](https://github.com/ArnoVel/causal-pictures/fitting/) is in the [pictures-only repo](https://github.com/ArnoVel/causal-pictures/).
